When can I access a WeWork location? What are the open hours?
If you have a Private Office at a WeWork location, you enjoy 24/7 access to that space. To access WeWork locations, other members need to book a meeting room or workspace in advance. The Community team is on-site at each location on weekdays from 9 AM to 6 PM (apart from holidays).
What is a service retainer?
The Service Retainer is a refundable fee paid before you move in, functioning similarly to a security deposit. This retainer will not be applied to your monthly membership fee until the end of your membership term; at that point, any outstanding dues will be adjusted, and the remaining amount will be refunded to you. Funds will be returned to members 60-90 days after the move-out date upon termination of their agreement.
What is WeWork's policy on working from another location?
Members can reserve meeting rooms or workspaces at other WeWork locations via the Member Network app. Costs are calculated in credits based on membership type, and a confirmation email will be sent upon booking, providing details on the reservation and pricing. Each membership includes a set number of credits, with any usage beyond this amount incurring an ‘Overage’ charge.


WeWork All Access Plus
All Access Plus members can book a desk at any WeWork location worldwide without deducting credits for accessing shared spaces. However, they must use their credits when booking conference rooms.


Dedicated space
Members with dedicated spaces, such as Private Offices, can also book a ‘Desk’ or ‘Room’ to access shared spaces or conference rooms through the Member Network app. These bookings will require the use of credits.


WeWork On-demand
On-demand users operate on a pay-per-use basis, allowing them to book day passes or conference rooms at any WeWork location. Pricing varies by location. Additionally, day pass bundles are only valid for the specific location for which they were purchased.
How do I book a space at another WeWork location?
You can book a workspace or meeting room using the Member Network app. For more details, refer to the articles "How to book a workspace" or "How to book a meeting room".
What is WeWork's keycard access policy?
Keycard access will be automatically activated once a booking is made. Members can access the reserved space 30 minutes before the reservation begins, and access will remain active for 30 minutes after the reservation ends.


Please note the following details regarding access:


1. The earliest time for accessing a non-home WeWork location is 9:00 AM.
2. The latest access time is 5:59 PM.
3. Outside of the hours of 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM on weekdays, as well as during all weekends and some national holidays, there will be no Community team on-site and amenities will be reduced.


When can I start booking meeting rooms and workspaces?
