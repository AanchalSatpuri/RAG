Commitment term
What does a minimum commitment term mean and what are its implications for me for WeWork Labs Growth Campus? 
* Under WeWork Growth Campus, each startup is required to commit to the All Access Plus membership for a minimum tenure of 3 calendar months.
* 3 full calendar months are calculated from the start date of your membership. Eg: If your start date is Jan 20th, your 3-month commitment term will be February, March, and April.
* A member cannot terminate their membership before the completion of their minimum commitment term of 3 calendar months.

Yes,  you can I upgrade or downgrade my WeWork Labs Growth Campus membership during my commitment period
