1. What is WeWork’s pet policy?
WeWork loves pets! However, some buildings may not permit animals due to building management policies. To check if pets are allowed in your building, please submit a support request.
* Key points to remember:
   * Members must provide pet vaccination records or service dog paperwork. Submit these documents via a support ticket for our Community team to keep on file.
   * Pets must be housebroken, remain in private offices, and should not roam unsupervised. Pets must be leashed in common areas.
   * The WeWork team may request that a pet be removed if they are disruptive, noisy, or destructive.
