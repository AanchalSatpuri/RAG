Would WeWork ask me for my personal or financial information?
* In order to protect our members from being the victims of phishing campaigns and the potential release of private information, WeWork prohibits personnel from asking members for their personal or financial information over the phone or via email. Phishing is a form of a social engineering attack attempting to obtain sensitive information by posing as a trustworthy entity via email or phone call.
* To help prevent our members from being exposed to these scams, we have compiled a list of ways to identify a fake email or phone call:
   * A phishing email may contain grammatical, spelling, or punctuation errors. WeWork’s external communication goes through strict quality assurance protocols before being delivered to our members. Therefore grammatical, spelling, or punctuation errors are highly unlikely from an authorized WeWork email.
   * A phishing email or phone call may include an urgent request for personal or financial information. WeWork will NEVER ask our members to provide their Social Security Number, passwords, or credit card number via email or over the phone.
   * A phishing email may ask our members to click on an embedded link. As a precaution, WeWork members should hold their mouse over masked links to reveal the actual web address before clicking through.

OFFICE
How do I add or remove WeWork furniture from my office?

Adding furniture

How do I adjust the temperature in my office?
The ability to set a specific temperature varies office-to-office depending on the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system and how it may affect neighboring offices in your temperature zone.
 
Temperatures set in communal areas are at a level for the comfort of all members using that space.
What can I do to ensure my HVAC system is running effectively?
HVAC systems are programmed to provide you comfort and save energy and our planet. We suggest the following to help your HVAC system runs effectively:
* Check that doors and windows are closed.
* Please do not use personal heaters, kettles, or coffee makers if possible. These can increase temperatures and affect the sensors for HVAC systems.
* Please check that temperature sensors are not blocked or next to heat sources.
* If you are working outside standard working hours, we try to save energy by altering the operation of our HVAC systems. Please see the on-site Community team for more information.
I have done the above and still want to change the temperature. What should I do?
Please check with members in your office to determine if there is an agreement to change the temperature. If there is an agreement, please see the on-site Community team to request that the temperature be changed.
 
It may take some time for the HVAC system to adjust the temperature. We appreciate your patience during this time.

What is WeWork's office signage policy?
Want your company name or logo on your office door?


WeWork supplies one complimentary piece of company signage per office, unless otherwise specified. The signage is an adhesive that is placed on your office window facing outwards towards the hallway, usually featuring your company name and logo.


To order one, submit a support request here - https://members.wework.com/workplaceone/content2/wework-support


If you would like to order an additional logo (because you updated the style of your logo, or you would like to request multiple logos for multiple windows) then a fee will apply and this varies by location. Please contact your Community team or submit a support request to find out more.


How often will my office be cleaned?
The health and safety of our members and global communities are our number one priority. That’s why we continue to take steps to enhance our spaces and services—ensuring that you can continue working with peace of mind.


Please view our Health and Safety commitment for more details. 


Note: Specific policies and practices may vary by country and city. We will monitor local regulations, and adapt our local policies and practices as necessary.
Can I add additional privacy vinyl or bring in blinds to make the space more private?
To ensure all members get natural light regardless of where their office is located, we don’t allow members to put anything up above the privacy vinyl line.




How are office sizes measured at WeWork?
WeWork determines office size by desk capacity instead of the typical square foot measurement. The offices are designed specifically for the number of people that are allowed to occupy the space at a given time.

MEMBER EXPECTATIONS 
What is WeWork's guest policy?
As a WeWork member*, you are welcome to invite guests into our buildings.




Pre-register your guests before arrival to optimize their experience. Guests will need to sign in at the front desk upon arrival. WeWork uses its proprietary system to document all guests entering a WeWork-operated location. Please make sure the guest brings their photo ID to check-in.




As a member, you are responsible for all actions conducted by your guests. You are required to be present in the building when your guests visit. Guests are not allowed in the building if the member is not there to collect them.




*Please note if you have an All Access Plus (including Global Access), or On-demand Membership, it is required you have a meeting room booked to host guests at any WeWork location. You can book meeting rooms on the member web or the WeWork app.




If you have any questions or require assistance, please see the on-site Community team or submit a support request here - https://members.wework.com/workplaceone/content2/wework-support
Are there rules and expectations for members and guests of members when on WeWork properties? 
Yes, member safety and satisfaction are incredibly important to us. Therefore, members are not allowed to use WeWork locations (including offices, coworking space, and amenities) for retail, medical, or non-business purposes — as well as anything else that would involve frequent non-member (public) visits.
Members should always treat one another with respect and are not allowed to misrepresent or make false claims about themselves or their guests to the WeWork community, whether  in person or within the Member Network. We also don’t allow members to use WeWork buildings, workspace, or amenities for illegal or offensive activities.
For more context, below is an excerpt from our Membership Agreement, which all members are required to agree to before joining:
 
Members may not: 
i.        use the Services, the Premises or the Office Space to conduct or pursue any illegal or offensive activities or comport themselves to the community in a similar manner; all Members shall act in a respectful manner towards other Member Companies and our and their employees and guests;
ii.       misrepresent himself or herself to the WeWork community, either in person or on the WeWork Member Network;
iii.       use the Office Space in a retail, medical, or other capacity involving frequent visits by members of the public, as a residential or living space, or for any exclusively non-business purpose;
